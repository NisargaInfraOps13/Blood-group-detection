# Blood-group-detection-using-fingerprint
Blood group detection using fingerprints through deep learning.
A deep learning project to predict blood groups (A, B, AB, O with Rh factor) from fingerprint images using CNNs. It offers a non-invasive, fast, and real-time alternative to traditional blood tests.
